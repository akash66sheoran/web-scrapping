During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match winning century in the first match, this was his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession. Indian team was victorious with 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, while Kohli's performances in the series helped him establish his position in the ODI team and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad.

      "When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad. He found success in the ODI series with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80 helping India in 3–2 win over West Indies . His best efforts came in the second ODI at Port of Spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave India a seven-wicket victory and the fifth ODI at Kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat. Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings. India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball.\n",

      "Initially got dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series. However Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj, though he did not get to play in any match of that series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80. His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches. In the last game of the series at Cardiff, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared 170 runs partnership with Rahul Dravid for the third wicket, who was playing his last ODI match. Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings .It was the only century in the series by any player of either team and earned him praise for his \"hard work\" and \"maturity\".\n",

      "In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90. This included unbeaten knock of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209 run partnership with Gambhir. Followed by innings of 86 at Mumbai, both the knocks came in successful run chases. Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series at Mumbai in which he scored a pair of fifties. India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run chase of 270. A knock which raised his reputation as \"an expert of the chase\". Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.\n",

      "During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed. While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match at Sydney, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. He top scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth with scores of 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat. In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century of 116 runs in the first innings. India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series was described as \"the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists\".\n",

Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare. India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock. Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as \"one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time\". However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series. With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.\n",

He scored 108 in the first match against Sri Lanka leading India to 50 runs victory. India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored his personal best of 183 from 148 balls, his 11th ODI century.

It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.

      "Kohli is considered an aggressive batsman with strong technical skills. He usually bats at the no.3 position in ODI cricket. He bats with a slightly open-chested stance and a strong bottom-hand grip.  He is not a big hitter and plays more grounded shots. He has frequent wrist shot play and is known for chasing down innings and batting under pressure. He is strong through the mid-wicket and cover region. He has said that the cover drive is his favourite shot, while also saying that the flick shot comes naturally to him. He does not play the sweep shot often.  Kohli is strong on leg stump line bowling. If bowled at leg stump he plays flick shot. He tends to score more in area between deep square leg to mid-on. Kohli often struggles on very wide outside the off stump line balling, thus got out on multiple times on 3rd to 7th off stump.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to cricket pundit like VVS Laxman, playing against the fast bowlers who bowl outside the off stump is his weakness. He has been exposed to getting dismissed by an outside off stump line ball and the opposition team's bowlers tries to exploit his weakness in Tests as well as ODIs.

      "Kohli is noted for his on-field aggression and was described in the media as \"brash\" and \"arrogant\" during his early career. He has got into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions. While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude, some have criticised it. In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but \"the build-up pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kohli is often compared to Sachin Tendulkar, due to their similar styles of batting, and sometimes referred to as Tendulkar's \"successor\". Many former cricketers expect Kohli to break Tendulkar's batting records. He is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN. Kohli has stated that growing up his idol and role model was Tendulkar and that as a kid he \"tried to copy the shots Tendulkar played and hit sixes the way he used to hit them.\" Former West Indies great Vivian Richards, who is regarded as the most destructive batsman in cricket, stated that Kohli reminds him of himself. In early 2015, Richards said Kohli was \"already legendary\" in the ODI format while former Australian cricketer Dean Jones called Kohli the \"new king of world cricket\".
